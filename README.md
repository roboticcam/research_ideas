# research_ideas
My research process is fueled by a constant stream of ideas 😊 . Naturally, many are rough drafts - far from being ready for publication. Some turn out to be things others have already done; some I talk myself out of; and others get shot down by my students. (Though, ironically, we sometimes see those 'students-do-not-like' ideas published at top conferences years later by other groups!)

That’s why I’ve decided to start sharing most of these early-stage thoughts more openly. Perhaps a raw idea that didn't make the cut for me will spark inspiration for you and grow into something amazing.
